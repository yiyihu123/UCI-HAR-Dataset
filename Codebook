The script generates a combined subset of the original data by extracting the mean and standard deviation features for each of the 33 processed signals, for a total of 66 features (out of the 561 available features from the original feature vector). This combined subset contains 10299 observations of 68 variables, with activity and subject appended to the 66 features.

The combined subset is further reduced by calculating the mean of the observations by activity and subject pair to generate 180 observations (6 activities * 30 subjects) of the same 68 variables. This dataset is tidied to generate a narrow and lean dataset containing 11880 observations with 4 variables each and is saved as a text file in the current working directory with the name tidy_data.txt

The Tidy dataset consists of 11880 observations summarized by activity (6 categories) and subject (30 volunteers) pairs. For each observation (row) in the Tidy dataset, the following 4 columns are provided:

subject
activity
measurement
mean
